				<h3>
					INFO 312: Enterprise Risk Management
				</h3>

				<p>
					Enterprise Risk Management was a class that emphasized the process of presenting cybersecurity concepts and risks in a corporate context. This involves assigning risks values for probability and projected loss, as well as generating a prioritized risk list. While the class was very useful and relevant, I desired material that was slightly more technical. One of the assignments was an individual project on a subject of our choosing; I chose to research the web application security risks faced by Nordstrom. I chose to focus my project on more technical aspects of these attacks: specifically SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting. This represented a few major things for me: first, a large and detailed paper, but more importantly, an opportunity to independently study this new field of application security. This independent research helped me realize that I had a strong interest in application security over network security; this paper had a significant role in my decision to pursue a career in web application security. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A very important aspect of this project was the emphasis on independent research in the security field. Cybersecurity is extremely volatile, with new vulnerabilities frequently appearing. Engineers have to constantly respond to these new vulnerabilities, so constant independent research and remaining up-to-date on current cybersecurity events is extremely important. This individual project assignment exposed me to the resources that I'd use to continue researching this field as well as stay updated on new vulnerabilities and 0-day exploits. This exposure allowed me to realize that I enjoy learning about this field, and that web security could be a very interesting field to pursue. This exposure is definitely one of the big factors behind me pursuing application security today.

					In Examination of Big Brother
				</h2>
				<h3>
					INFO 450: Information Ethics and Policy
				</h3>
				<p>
					Information Ethics and Policy was a very interesting and engaging nontechnical class that focused on the responsible and ethical dilemmas posed by information gathering and transfer. The course covered shady, morally questionable actions and events that are extremely relevant in today's online world. We discussed Facebook's tendency to record and store (and sometimes release) all forms of user information; something that still greatly impacts users and their safety. This term paper was an examination of one of the more interesting reading assignments: James Taylor's <i>In Praise of Big Brother</i>. Taylor argues for the liberation of information, defending the idea that to withhold information is to withhold progress. In this sense, Taylor argues, constant and widespread government surveillance is not only morally permissible, but the next logical step in global safety and justice.
				</p>
				<p>
					In response to Taylor's perspective, I was forced to think about the roles that I thought information should play in real-world contexts. This was an interesting mental exercise because my education up to this point in technology had strictly been in technical contexts--I was tasked with making functionality work, but never with questioning if the functionality was something that I wanted to bring into the world in the first place. I also had a brief encounter with the ethical issues rooted in cybersecurity: if your service is storing private user information, saving money by not adequately securing your info systems could be a fundamentally unethical act. For the first time in my academic career, I was thinking about the role my technical creations--and by extention I myself--would play in the real world.

					Shake 'n Bacon: HashTable Open Addressing

				<h3>
					CSE 373: Data Structures and Algorithms
				</h3>
				<p>
					Data Structures and Algorithms is a difficult class; I went into the quarter knowing that I would have to spend much more time on it than I may have had to spend on other classes. I made sure to always follow attentively during lecture and take my time on the homework. I didn't have significant problems with the class, until the Shake 'n Bacon assignment. We were tasked with writing our own hash tables that would allow our program to quickly read through the works of William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon, populating hash tables with a word count of all words found within each of the authors' works. These hashtables would have to return values fast enough to efficiently run a correlation algorithm between the two data sets, finding similarities and differences in vocabulary and writing style.
				</p>
				<p>	
					I chose this artifact because I am proud of it. The homework was very challenging, and I spent more time on this assignment than I have on any other. Between every class I'd work on the homework in the lab, and had food delivered so I could continue working. Part of the difficulty of this assignment was the coordination between my partner and I: the homework was a partner assignment, and we decided the best way to approach it was to divide the functionality and then later combine our code. We realized that working on the same project independently was extremely difficult; reading each other's code and making changes to implement each of our assigned workloads into the master branch was a nightmare (this was before I learned how to use code repositories, another valuable experience!). To make up for our poor planning, we had to work together for the rest of the assignment, rewriting our old code. This project taught my the importance of aggresive, deliberate planning, as well as how to collaborate on technical assignments. More importantly, it was a massive challenge I had to overcome; knowing that I have the capacity to focus and work around-the-clock has helped motivate me when I found my attention drifting during long hours on later assignments.
