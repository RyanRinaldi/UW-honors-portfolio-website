Turning Point

My period of transition occurred over the length of a school quarter. I was taking a class on computer networking and network security,
and immediately felt flooded. I remember I spent much of the first two classes wondering if I had somehow missed a prerequisite class, as the instructor expected us to have so much knowledge and all the students around me seemed to be easily following along, while I was having a hard time grasping the basics. Having decided I wanted to pursue this track in Informatics, I began to quietly panic that my career choice wasn’t right for me. I resolved to give the class my best effort before I let it dictate my education track, and spent every night that first week researching network systems and security. After the first week I finally felt competent enough to at least start asking questions in the classroom. 

The professor was an incredibly invested instructor; by the second week he knew the name of every person in that classroom. This made it much easier for me to talk to him about my struggles in his class; he reassured me by understanding that his class was overwhelming and was very information-dense. However, as class went on, I found my research beginning to pay off: I was understanding concepts and able to contribute to class discussions. This class was structured without homework, and we were only tested on two easy tests the entire year. As I took this class, realizing that the material was difficult but I had no homework to complete for it, I began to see my focus shift. Throughout my college career I typically studied to get through the week: learning enough to finish homework assignments and cramming for tests. With the reduced workload of this class, however, I realized that the professor was putting me in a position of responsibility, allowing me to decide whether or not I committed to understanding the material. 

By giving me the freedom to either commit fully to the material or ignore it and pass through an easy class without homework, I felt the professor offered me a challenge: “is this class really important to you?” Deciding that the class was indeed important to me meant that I had to focus on educating myself, rather than focusing on my grade. Since then, this mindset has bled into other aspects of my life. I now approach all classes similarly: I study the material in an effort to improve, rather than to get through the period, the day, the week, the quarter. I no longer feel like I need to study particularly hard for finals, having spent the entire quarter actively learning and absorbing the material. I make it a point not to study the night before small quizzes, finding it more valuable to use quiz marks to determine deficient areas of my understanding. While a good quiz grade can make it easier to pass a class with a high grade, knowing the areas I struggle with are more important; information I learn the nights I spend cramming seem to be gone by next week. Even in the gym, I no longer focus on lifting the weight to complete all of today’s reps, but rather focus on form and balance to ensure that I grow strong enough for next week’s weight. This attitude shift, from measuring my ability to an internal focus on improvement, marks one of the most significant turning points in my life.
