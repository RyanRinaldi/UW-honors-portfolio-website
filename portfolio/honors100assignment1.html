The "Social Animal"

As I read the article “Social Animal” on the New Yorker, I was confronted with many comparisons that seemed to accurately describe much of the motivation and philosophy behind the ideas I maintained about my life. Specifically, I was confronted by the need I have to be successful, and the actions I take to place myself on a path that will end with my realization of this goal. The article guides the reader to examine the measures he takes to make himself happy, and compares that with the measures taken by that of the “Composure Class.” These measures include the development through career skills through education. Personally, I was able to identify with many of the measures taken by the Composure Class, and the motivation behind these efforts.

The biggest similarity I found between myself and members of the Composure Class was the emphasis that society puts on particular aspects of my education. Specifically, the goals of my education match closely with the ideals of the men of the Composure Class. None of the “high level” education at my school focused on achieving fulfillment, confidence, or social skills. Instead, I studied calculus and dissected wordy short stories by Borges. All of the classes I took oriented me towards achieving success in the corporate world: my classes taught me how to be productive and to efficiently analyze data and produce results. In short, my success would be judged by a deity outside of myself that would review my data and analysis. My output, what I was able to create, the value of my work, would determine my value. It took me a long time (from junior high to the end of senior year) to realize that my value and idea of self-worth has to be generated from within myself, not by any external factors. The Composure Class also struggles with this issue, as it is trained to believe that happiness and success stems from productivity and intelligence.

If my happiness is not dependent on my success in the corporate world, and thus my education/productivity, why would I choose to challenge myself with the rigors of higher education? Why would I go on to further burden my time by becoming a part of the honors program? I do not feel that my happiness is dependent on an external perspective on my productivity; rather, I choose to strive for academic excellence and challenging courses. This is something that is important to me intrinsically, not because my productivity will be important to some corporation in the future. Rather, I value my education because I can ­only realize my full potential with a high level education. I do aspire to be successful in the corporate world, but because that kind of success will bring me fulfillment. Success in education has always been a standard for me: in order to feel good about myself, I have to succeed at the highest levels of school. This is a voluntary standard that I hold myself to, and it comes from a conscious decision from within me, not from the evaluations of others of my productivity and my contributions to the corporate world.

I choose to succeed in education because I believe it in an important aspect on the quality of life. A major motivation, however, is success in the business world. Yes, these values are pushed upon me and enforced during education, but they are values I feel are important regardless of how they are learned. It is possible to live in today’s world without education or a career, but having an education undoubtedly opens up infinitely more possibilities and opportunities. I make the decision to achieve at the highest levels of education because I do not want to limit myself so early in my life. By doing everything that I can and being the best possible student, I can open up my future for many more opportunities than if I had chosen a path that did not value education. This is the reason I’ve joined the Honors system in the University of Washington. I want to succeed at the greatest levels of education in order to build myself a limitless future. This is what I am looking for in classes at the UW; I am looking for opportunities to expand my education and to learn more than what is being taught to the Composure Class. I am looking for opportunities that will define me and pique my interest and thus will later direct me toward fulfillment rather than simply success in the business world. I am looking for an education that will steer me towards happiness and fulfillment rather than the Composure Class.
