<h2>Teaching Woodmoor Students the Importance of Cyber Safety</h2>
Experiential Learning Category Service

<em>Summarize your proposed experiential learning activity, including the primary focus of your activity, your intended actions, and the expectations of your supervisor and/or organization/partners.</em>

The driving purpose of this project is to educate young students (elementary school aged) about online safety and safe online behavior. This is a new project for me, something I have no experience in (having never spoken in front of a young classroom) but on a topic I have knowledge in. I will have to start from scratch, creating my own topics and speech materials, ensuring that I hit all the major areas of online safety while keeping my talk accessible and digestible for a younger audience.


<em>Explain how your activity demonstrates the values of the Honors Program Experiential Learning area you selected. Rather than reiterating our definition, outline how your activity embodies this definition.</em>

The experiential learning area this project fulfills is service; I will be working in particular with certain members of an organization that help promote and teach online safety in the Northshore School District. This work is extremely community-oriented, and will help maintain safety for members of the community, not just the students I will be speaking to. Less technologically-inclined parents may not be able to adequately educate their child in safe online behavior; this lack of understanding has caused harm to entire families when one child unknowingly releases sensitive information. I believe the work I will be doing will have a positive impact on the entire community.


<em>How and why did you select this engagement? What skills or experiences do you hope to gain from it?</em>

Having come through the Northshore School District myself, I have a fond connection towards it and the students it educates. Having studied cybersecurity at UW, I have a strong background in online safety in general and understand what kind of information is safe to expose and what information should be well hidden. I believe this background is extremely important; having sat through similar talks at a similar age, I was always taught that no personal information at all should ever be shared online. Even as a child I understood that this policy was overly strict, which made me less inclined to follow it. As I matured I learned proper online safety, which balances between the understanding of harmless information (first names) and harmful.


<em>How does this activity connect to your concurrent or past coursework? How does it speak to your broader education goals and experiences?</em>

I currently am finishing studies in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance in the information undergrad school at UW. This background has helped me recognize what kind of information could be harmful if in the hands of those with malicious intent, and what kind of information is helpful for collaboration and teamwork while remaining harmless even in the hands of an attacker. This understanding and judgement of what kind of information is harmful and safe is what I would like to teach my audience. I want to work on my public speaking skills and presentation skills for my professional career, and this project would help me translate my technical skills into presentation skills for a non-technical audience.


<em>How will your activity contribute to the larger goals of the organization/your partners?</em>

My specific responsibilities for the NSD online safety organization would be to research, construct, and develop my own speech, then go classroom to classroom giving my speech. The organization does not have the employees or manpower to give classroom-sized talks; however, classroom-sized talks (as opposed to school-wide talks) allow for greater audience participation and engagement, as well as help facilitate a wider participation during question and answer portions. My non-profit volunteering aims to allow the organization to extend its services to these classroom talks at no cost to itself.
