			<h2>
				Learning Statement
			</h2>
			<p>
				Like every student that goes to college, my time with the University has been an extremely formulative experience. Naturally, a large part of that is the fact that the four years between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two are some of the most critical in a person's life. It is in these years that a person has to decide what they stand for, what they want from life, and what they want to contribute. High school graduation is a graduation from complacency and security; this was when I lost the ability to diffuse responsibility. Part of this is the college environment: the physical move away from my parents, living with peers that serve as all kinds of influences and live in a massive spectrum of lifestyles, and the loss of teachers and faculty keeping track of me and my responsibilities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The independence that I've learned from my experience in college cannot be overstated. I underestimated how influential the act of moving to college was; I have absolutely learned more from living with my friends and participating in college life than I have in the classroom. That's not to say that the classroom education was not valuable or important, but college taught me how to be a part of society first, and how to be a security engineer second. One of the biggest realizations for me was the understanding that I had to consciously make an effort to make friends and connect with people. The proximity, long hours, and activites in high school and earlier meant that making friends was inevitable, but the individualism in college meant that I would not make any connections if I did not make the effort to extend them. This was one of the most important lessons I've learned in how to live and thrive in society.
			</p>

				The time I spent in the classroom has absolutely been formulative and has helped me grow in many ways. Besides the obvious growth in technical nderstanding and professional skill, I've learned responsibility and self-reliance. The cliche, yet extremely relevant anecdote of struggling with the independence of college has been an important learning experience. The unstructured collaboration that was prevalent throughout my college education forced me to manage my own schedule, manage my interactions with teammates, and more importantly manage my own education. The most valuable academic skill I have learned from college is how to independently study, research, and develop my marketable skills. While I expected my professors to teach me the material themselves instead of sending me to finish reading or research independently, I slowly learned how to learn. My professors never offered me a fish; instead they taught me how to fish for myself.
